1. What is Boolean? Write down 3 different expression that results a Boolean type?
- A Boolean value is either true or false.
- In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False.

   Write down 3 different expression that results a Boolean type:
- 9 == (3*3) : True
- 9 != (3*3) : False
- n = "Mot"
  n + " Hai" == "Mot Hai"
True

3. What is nested conditionals? Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals?
 
The outer conditional contains two branches. The second branch contains another if statement,
which has two branches of its own. Those two branches could contain conditional statements
as well.

	Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals:

from random import randint
x = randint(0, 100)
print(x)
if x < 40:
    print("nho")
else :
    if x > 60:
        print("to")
    else:
        print("vua")
